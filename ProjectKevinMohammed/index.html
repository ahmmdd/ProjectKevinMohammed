            <p>
                Dear Harvey,
                "It is not often in life that we have the opportunity to have not one but two successful business dealings separated by some twenty three years but that has been our history. The impression that you, Aly left with me was significant and lasting and which made you the only choice for the "last hurrah." You have been so much more than a real estate agent to me and I refer of course to your generosity and valuable advice many years ago that helped me stay on course with investing. I thank you very much for all of that along with your community service given so freely over so many years. All the best to you and yours."

            <h3>Feedback #2</h3>
            <p>
                "I would like to thank you for looking after the sale of my home recently that closed on October 31st.
                Your expertise, patience, support and knowledge made the whole experience less stressful.
                There was always a personal touch. You spent umlimited time with me which was beyond anything that I expected.
                I would highly recommend Royal LePage for selling or buying a house. My family and I will always remember this as a positive experience.
